### LEVEL 1 CHALLENGE

Chasing the Clicks

﻿
### 1. CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
- Build a web page (or any kind of hosted web app) with a clickable button and a click count. 
- Every time that the button is clicked, the number increases by 1. When the web page is refreshed, the click count number should reflect all previous clicks. 
- Refreshing the page should not reset the count to 0 or any other default number.

﻿

### Bonus Points 
- Showing on the web page the distribution of clicks by geography. 
- This could be a simple table, a map or any other way that you can think of.
